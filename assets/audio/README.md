# Audio Assets

Place sound effects here, for example:

- `jump.wav`
- `music.wav`

The demo tries to load `assets/audio/jump.wav`.
If file is missing, the engine continues without sound playback.

The demo also tries to load looped background music:

- `assets/audio/music.wav`

If `music.wav` is missing, engine startup still succeeds.
